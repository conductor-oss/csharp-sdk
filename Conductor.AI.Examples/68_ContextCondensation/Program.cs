// Context Condensation Stress Test — orchestrator + sub-agent, history condenses 3+ times.
//
// An orchestrator agent calls a deep_analyst sub-agent once per technology domain.
// The sub-agent fetches raw domain data and writes a comprehensive ~600-word analysis.
// Each sub-agent result lands in the orchestrator's conversation history as a large
// tool-call output (~800 tokens). After roughly 10 calls the accumulated history
// exceeds the configured context window and the server automatically condenses it.
// This repeats ~3 times across the 25 domains.
//
// Architecture:
//   orchestrator
//     └── agent_tool(deep_analyst) × 25 topics
//           └── fetch_domain_data(domain)  ← structured facts/stats
//
// Setup — required for condensation to trigger:
//   Add to server/src/main/resources/application.properties and restart:
//   agentspan.default-context-window=10000
//
// Requirements:
//   - Agentspan server with LLM support + agentspan.default-context-window=10000
//   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api in environment
//   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in environment
