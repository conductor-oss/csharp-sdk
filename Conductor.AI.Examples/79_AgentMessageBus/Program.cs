// Agent Message Bus — two agents communicating via Workflow Message Queue.
//
// Demonstrates:
//   - Agent-to-agent messaging: a Researcher forwards results directly into
//     a Writer agent's WMQ via runtime.SendMessageAsync()
//   - A tool that closes over an execution_id to forward results downstream
//   - Parallel agent pipelines: researcher → writer running concurrently
//   - Deterministic stop: handle.StopAsync() exits each agent's loop gracefully
//
// How this differs from 06_SequentialPipeline:
//   The >> operator in example 06 compiles a static DAG upfront. Here both
//   agents are independent running workflows. The Researcher decides at runtime
//   when and what to forward, and could conditionally route or fan out.
//
// Scenario:
//   A Researcher agent receives topics, produces bullet-point notes, then
//   forwards them to a Writer agent that turns them into a polished paragraph.
//   The main thread only sends topics to the Researcher — the Researcher
//   autonomously drives the Writer.
//
// Requirements:
//   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in environment
//   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in environment
