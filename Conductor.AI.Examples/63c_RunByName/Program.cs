// Run by Name — execute a pre-deployed agent via runtime.RunByNameAsync(name, prompt).
//
// This pattern decouples execution from deployment:
//   - CI/CD deploys the workflow definition once (using agent config)
//   - Application code runs it by name (no Agent object needed at runtime)
//   - Workers register separately as long-running services
//
// For agents that use only server-side tools (HTTP, MCP, API) — no worker
// process is needed. This example uses a server-side HTTP tool so both
// the initial run and run-by-name work without local workers.
//
// Requirements:
//   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api in environment
//   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in environment
