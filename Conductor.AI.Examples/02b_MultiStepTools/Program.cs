// Multi-Step Tool Calling — chained lookups and calculations.
//
// The agent has four tools. The prompt requires it to:
// 1. Look up a customer's account
// 2. Fetch their recent transactions
// 3. Calculate the total spend
// 4. Formulate a final answer using all the data
//
// This shows the agent loop in action: the LLM calls tools one at a
// time, feeds each result into the next decision, and stops when it has
// enough information to answer.
//
// In the Conductor UI you'll see each tool call as a separate DynamicTask
// with clear inputs/outputs, making it easy to trace the reasoning chain.
//
// Requirements:
//   - Agentspan server with LLM support
//   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in environment
//   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in environment
