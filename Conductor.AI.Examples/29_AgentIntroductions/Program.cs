// Agent Introductions — agents introduce themselves before a group discussion.
//
// The Introduction property adds a self-introduction to the conversation
// transcript at the start of multi-agent group chats, helping agents
// understand who they're collaborating with.
//
// Requirements:
//   - Agentspan server with LLM support
//   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in environment
//   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in environment
