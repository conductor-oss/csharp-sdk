// Secret injection for framework passthrough — concurrency-safe.
//
// Implements the SDK contract documented in
// docs/design/secret-injection-contract.md. The naive
// "SetEnvironmentVariable, invoke, restore" pattern is unsafe under
// concurrency because the process environment is shared across all threads.
//
// Tier 2 (env injection, this file): holds a process-wide async lock across
// mutation + invocation + restoration so concurrent framework workers serialize
// instead of clobbering each other. Strictly serial within one worker process;
// scale by adding worker processes.
//
// Tier 1 (explicit-key passthrough): users pass resolved credentials directly into
// their framework's model client (e.g. `new OpenAIClient(apiKey: credentials["..."])`).
// No lock, fully concurrent. The user-facing API change lands in a future PR.
